# Keynote Booking Strategy - Final Plan

## The Core Problem
Get Costa booked for more keynotes ($5K-12K each) to grow Innovation Bound's revenue and lead generation.

---

## The Solution: Multi-Layer Strategy

### 1. Cold Outreach (Indirect Approach)
**Hook:** "I'd like to hire you on a contract basis"
**Target:** Event organizers, association directors, EO/Vistage chapter heads

**Email Flow:**
- Email 1: "Sarah - I'd like to hire you on a contract basis"
- Email 2: "To promote our AI training to your network - $1K per referral. But you should experience our work first."
- Options to experience: Watch keynote reel OR Join monthly live event

**Why This Works:**
- 8-16X more people watch content vs direct pitch
- Curiosity hooks get 46% open rate vs 27-36% for direct pitches
- Natural flip: They watch → think "YOU should speak at MY event" → book you

**Channel:** LinkedIn-first (safer, better response rates 10-20% vs email 5%)

---

### 2. The Keynote: "Replace & Enhance"

**Title:** "Replace & Enhance: Powering Your Business with AI"

**Core Framework:**
- **Replace:** Work that shouldn't exist anymore (stale tools, manual processes, time waste)
- **Enhance:** Work that could be 10X better (strategy, content, communication)

**Keynote Structure (60 min):**

1. **Hook (5 min):** "Two types of work in every business..."
2. **Framework (10 min):** Replace & Enhance examples with $ impact
3. **Live Demo (30 min):** Podcast guest outreach for Innovation Bound
   - Claude Code does prospecting + drafting in real-time
   - Audience watches interface update live
   - Send 15-20 pitches during talk
   - Check for replies (28% expected rate)
   - Backup: Show previous results
4. **Framework Tool (10 min):** 4-step process walkthrough
   - Rank growth constraints
   - Rank time sucks
   - Match to AI strengths
   - Score feasibility + testability
   - Pick ONE to pilot this week
5. **The Offer (5 min):** AI Transformation Partnership

---

### 3. The Live Demo (Technical)

**What We're Demonstrating:**
Podcast guest outreach automation (proving Replace & Enhance works)

**How It Works:**
- Claude Code runs prospecting workflow
- Real-time Deno server on localhost shows progress
- Audience sees interface (not just code)
- Can toggle to show "under the hood" code view
- Approve/edit drafts with button clicks
- Send via MCP (email or LinkedIn)
- Check for responses during talk

**Why Podcast Outreach:**
- 28% positive reply rate (proven)
- Lead generation for Innovation Bound
- Tangible business value
- Works even without live replies (show past results)

---

### 4. The Offer: "AI Transformation Partnership"

**Structure:**
- $5K deposit (before talk ends)
- 90-day exclusive engagement
- Target: Minimum $50K gain (profit up OR costs down)
- Fee: 40% of documented gains
- Guarantee: No $50K gain = $10K back to them ($5K refund + $5K penalty)

**Hero Incentive:**
First person to book → everyone in audience gets free workshop ($497 value)

**Proof:**
Share last engagement results:
- Company name
- Specific $ saved/earned
- Timeline
- Screenshots/proof

**Scarcity:**
- ONE per quarter
- Offer expires when you leave stage
- Next slot not available for 90 days

---

### 5. The 3-Minute Reel

**Structure:**
- 0:00-0:10: Pattern interrupt ("I build businesses on stage, sometimes they make first sale before I leave")
- 0:10-0:30: Credentials (NASA, $200M raised, software engineer since 2010)
- 0:30-1:30: Money shot (live results, multiple examples, audience reactions)
- 1:30-2:00: Social proof (testimonials with business impact)
- 2:00-2:30: Differentiation ("Members get actual results + you can facilitate referrals")
- 2:30-3:00: CTA (contact info, final engaged audience shot)

**Key:** Show RESULTS, not just "I'm a good speaker"

---

### 6. Monthly Live Event (60 min)

Same structure as keynote, used to:
- Let event organizers experience your work
- Convert to paid keynote bookings
- Sell AI Transformation Partnerships
- Build audience/leads

---

### 7. The 4-Step Framework (Audience Takeaway)

**Tool:** Interactive worksheet/Notion template

**Steps:**
1. Rank your constraints to business growth (what's holding you back most?)
2. Rank time sucks (what consumes most time for you/employees?)
3. Learn AI's key strengths (what is ChatGPT actually good at?)
4. Match #3 to #1 and #2. Score feasibility and testability.
5. Pick ONE to pilot this week (forces action)

**Deliverable:** QR code → tool → they fill out during talk → get custom roadmap

---

## Revenue Streams

### Primary: Keynote Fees
$5K-12K per event (main goal)

### During Keynote: AI Transformation Partnership
$5K + 40% of gains (one per quarter)

### Post-Keynote: Custom Training Referrals
$9K per company (event organizers make $1K commission)

### Long-Term: Referral Partners
Event organizers who've experienced your keynote refer companies for training

---

## Why This Works

### Differentiation
- Not "here's what AI can do" → "watch AI work in real-time"
- Not slides → live building
- Not theory → actual results
- Not another AI speaker → NASA consultant who codes

### Proof
- Live demo with real results (or show past results)
- Business impact explicit ($ saved/earned)
- Multiple examples (Replace + Enhance)
- Case studies woven throughout

### Conversion
- Multiple offers at different price points
- Scarcity is real (time-bound, limited spots)
- Hero incentive creates FOMO
- Framework tool = tangible takeaway

### Scalability
- Cold outreach automated (LinkedIn via AI)
- Keynote is repeatable
- Monthly live event builds pipeline
- Referral partnerships compound

---

## Key Metrics to Track

**Cold Outreach (per 100 emails):**
- Open rate: 46% target (curiosity hooks)
- Reply rate: 15-25% target
- Watch reel/join event: 8-16 people
- Keynote bookings: 1-2

**Keynote Performance:**
- AI Transformation bookings: 1 per keynote (goal)
- Direct training inquiries: 3-5
- Follow-up referral partnerships: 1-2 event organizers

**Overall Goal:**
10-20 paid keynotes in next 6 months = $50K-240K revenue

---

## Next Steps to Execute

1. **Build the technical demo** (podcast outreach with Claude Code + Deno server)
2. **Create the framework tool** (interactive worksheet/Notion template)
3. **Film the 3-min reel** (with testimonials + proof + live results)
4. **Set up monthly live event** (date, registration, promotion)
5. **Build the cold outreach system** (LinkedIn-first, AI-powered)
6. **Test everything end-to-end** (rehearse keynote, demo, offers)

---

## Critical Success Factors

### The Demo Must Work Flawlessly
- Technical rehearsal required
- Backup plan if no live replies
- Show both interface + code
- Narrate what's happening

### The Framework Must Be Tangible
- Interactive tool, not just concept
- They fill it out during talk
- Walk away with personalized roadmap

### The Offer Must Feel Safe
- Risk reversal ($10K back if no results)
- Social proof (show last engagement)
- Hero incentive (everyone benefits)

### The Reel Must Show Results
- Not "I'm good" → "here's what happened"
- Audience reactions
- Specific $ impact
- Multiple proof points
